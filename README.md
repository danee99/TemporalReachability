# TemporalGraph
An implementation of a graph class for temporal graphs. A temporal graph has for each edge a time label indicating at what time the edge is available. A temporal graph is represented here as a list of nodes and a list of lists, with the edges starting from the respective node. 

self.incidence_list[node] is the list of all edges starting from "node".
